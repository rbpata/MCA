7.Admission to a professional course is subject to the following
conditions :
a. marks in mathematics >= 60
b. marks in physics >= 50
c. marks in chemistry >= 40
d. total in all three subjects >= 200
or
total in mathematics and physics >= 150
Given the marks in the three subjects , write a program to process the
applications to list an eligible candidate.x

#Code :-

maths=int(input("Enter Maths Marks : "));
physics=int(input("Enter Physics Marks : "));
chemistry=int(input("Enter Chemistry Marks : "));

total=maths+physics+chemistry;
math_pysics=maths+physics;

if maths >= 60 and physics >= 50 and chemistry >= 40:
    if total>=200 or math_pysics>=150:
        print("The candidate is eligible for admission.");
    else:
        print("The candidate is not eligible for admission.");
else:
    print("The candidate is not eligible for admission.");


#Output :-

Enter Maths Marks : 80
Enter Physics Marks : 70
Enter Chemistry Marks : 60
The candidate is eligible for admission.
